// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a = 1
b = 3
sum = a+b
sum = 4

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

take number
remainder=number%2
if remainder==0 
 print even
else
 print odd


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following. 
a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
   
READ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
set avg to (2+4+6+8+10)/5
write avg

If(2<4)
 Set max to 4
Else
 Set max to 2  
If(6 >max)
 set max to 6
If(8 >max)
 Set max to 8
If(10 >max)
 Set Max to 10
Write "The Max is"

If(2 >4)
 Set min to 4
Else
 Set min to 2
If(6 <min)
 set min to 6
If(8 <min)
 set min to 8
If (10 <min)
 Set min to 10
Write "The Min is"
